Unlike in high level languages(c, c++,python) in assembly languages, its the programmer's duty to arrange the stack, pushing Segment and Instruction pointers to the stack to know where to return after the function is executed. And 
nested loops are harder to implement. In this problem I have implemented a nested  recursion function. As given above. 

Also in the XXX_B file, I have implemented the same function using dynamic programming aproach. Which works faster as it doesn't re-calculate already calculated values

After the values are calculated, I printed them to the console using INT 21H Interruption, which only prints characters so I loop over the number and print in ASCII, there is no built-in print-like function in x86 assembly. It is only possible using such IO interruptions
